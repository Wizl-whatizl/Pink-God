          Pink Guy roams the earth for billions of (human) years, calling out to his long lost friends, lovers, and enemies. There will never be a response. There is nothing.
          Pink Guy entered Frank's life when Frank's original dimension in Okinawa disappeared, as Frank was in the realm of the darkness, Pink Guy appeared before him as a messenger of an unknown entity and tells him all about the Peace Lords and Chin Chin, This was revealed in the book, Francis of the Filth, Pink Guy could not escape that realm, for he cannot generate chromosomes in that realm, Frank makes Pink Guy come with him, Frank went to the coordinates Pink Guy gave and went to a realm where they were safe for a time.
          <p>Although spouting gibberish and having a speech problem, Pink Guy has astonishing skill at rapping. However, while he may be busting a few good rhymes, to others, like Filthy Frank, he still sounds as if he is just letting out strange gurgled sounds and appears to be doing random things such as swinging a stick around or hitting things together. Pink Guy seemingly possesses the ability to speak Japanese and English, however in all occasions, speaking English appears to require great effort for him and often is only done under extreme emotional stress or confidence. Pink Guy's typical incoherent outbursts can, however, occasionally be understood by others, like Filthy Frank or his nemesis/former lesbian relationship Green Cunt.

In one of his tracks from his album, FF and the Crew, Pink Guy is introduced by Frank. Instead of 'rapping', Pink instead leads with a long Japanese intro. It is slurred, garbled, and has references to English-coined terms (Down Syndrome) with no Japanese equivalence. Pink Guy seemingly has a seizure with Filthy Frank trying to comfort him.

After this seizure, he transitions into his usual 'rapping' persona, and even uses a wail that Red Dick] is known to perform, which sound like a sharp "AHHHHHH!". This hints at how to others, Pink Guy speaks insanely and incoherently, but in his own mind, he has perfect speech: this is also demonstrated in many other segments of The Filthy Frank Show.

In the book, Francis of The Filth, when he first meets with Frank in the dark realm, He is said to have a beautiful voice in that realm.</p>
          <p>Although he has cancer, depression, pussy addiction, erectile disfunction, chronic masturbation disorder, is completely autistic, and retarded with down syndrome, Pink Guy possess some special abilities. He is a great break dancer, as shown in his "WELCOME TO JAPAN" video. He has shown some skill in combat and he is able to summon Saint Nicholas when in need to defeat his opponents as we learned in the Christmas special. He also seems to be able to travel across realms with his pink stealth.

He is also a very skilled with firearms as seen in Hitler's Evil Son as he was able to fight Nazi Cunt alongside Derek while in his time drifting car Pink Stealth.

Pink guy also possesses the ability to puke out eggs as seen at the end of "PINK GUY COOKS FRIED RICE AND RAPS", along with puking out canned beans as seen in "THE ALMIGHTY PINK GUY", where he pukes some on Frank's face, similar to Dade's power to puke chocolate.

Pink Guy can also fire a pink laser from his ass, as seen in the battle against Evil Dade.</p>
